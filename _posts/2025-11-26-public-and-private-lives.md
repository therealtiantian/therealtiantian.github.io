Being a “einwohnerin” in a country other than my own puts me in a niche condition of “neither nor,” and the consequent of this is a detachment from the public sphere. A person normally has two roles, one that lives privately, joys the company with friends, and discusses affairs that pertain to the small social group; another that lives publicly and participates in matters that involve all inhabitants in the local area who do not necessarily know each other. I am now only living a private life. 

That is why there is a century-long motif of exile. Among the first known English poems, The Wanderer is one that already describes this problem. Exile is often considered to be one of the most pathetic conditions of human experience, because the one on exile is stripped of a social responsibilities. They can of course fulfill their personal wishes, start new social circles, but their public role is irreversibly removed. The new environment usually do not grant them the legitimacy of public participation. That is to say, even if they are granted rights legally, the de-facto condition is dubious. 

Of course, I am not an exile. But during this period of my life, we share this similarity. I do not have either natural interest or legal rights in making decisions in the place I live in, while despite of my interest and rights in matters of the country of my citizenship, I am not involved in any discussions there either. This puts me in a public vacuum. 

I actually indulge myself in a quality private life when I do not have access to the public one, and enjoy this side to the full, so I do not mean to complain. And this condition is not permanant, either. What I wanted to say is both these two aspects are indispensable to a life with intergrity. Besides, being temporarily stripped of either one of them only reminds the person in question to realise its importance and involve themselves more when it is regained.
