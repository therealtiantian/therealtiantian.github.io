新世纪之歌

作者：田甜

一只小羊乘风而下，

坐在蛇状的光里，嘴里振振有词。

俯向一片绿得震惊的屋顶，

它想起了学习短跑的那个下午，

母亲给予的那些让人心碎的东西。

无法破译的霞的信号，

潜伏在它的内脏中间，

据于脾的西部，给生活

带来些许不便。

就一个周三来说，这些叙述

有些过于冗长了。你总是如此，

让羊为难。

浅湾上已有了一层使人

心情不畅的材料，

羊看到其中的屋顶、霞和心的碎片，

向瓦格纳祈祷，这次是真的，

重新来过。

“我会做一个全新的小羊，克制

城市、大厦和茶水间的诱惑，

和刀保持距离。”

田甜，现生活与学习于瑞士。

song of a new century

translated by PLS

a lamb rides the wind down,

sitting inside snake-shaped light, speaking in an argumentative manner.

bending towards a terribly green roof,

it starts to recall the afternoon when it learned to sprint,

the heartbroken things its mother had given it.

the indecipherable signals of the sunset glow,

ambushing its internal organs,

occupying the west of the spleen, bringing

some difficulties to life.

for a Wednesday, this account

is too tedious. you’re always like this,

making it difficult for the lamb.

there has been a layer of unpleasant

materials across the shoal,

in which the lamb sees the roof, the glow and the broken heart,

prays to Wagner*, this time for real,

i will start over again.

“i will be a new lamb, resist

the temptation from the city, skyscrapers and tea room,

and keep a safe distance from blades."

*Richard Wagner, German composer and theatre director.
