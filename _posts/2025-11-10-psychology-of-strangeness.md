I did not go all in learning German during the first two years in Switzerland. Starting this September, I started to learn it consistently and after two months I can now understand everything within my everyday eyesight. 

The striking thing I noticed is how that affects one’s psychology in the environment. One sense in particular is gone, that is, fear. When the world did not reveal itself to me, but at the same time, when I knew there was meaning, I had quite some fear. When I walked in the street, I could hear meanings, see meanings, but they were beyond my ability of interpretation, which immediately triggers the coping mechanism of danger. Fight or flight? Mostly I chose to stay somewhere without German meaning, in my personal space, in nature, or in my English speaking social circle. I have always had the habit of reading the world like a book, for example, I like reading street signs and stickers, I like reading advertisement and instruction lines on trucks. When I wasn’t able to read the German in the streets, the fun was not there, because there were only questions from within my mental realm, but no answers from the environment. When the world creates constantly more mysteries to me without hinting at some of the answers, the fun was not there. 

However, now the fun comes back. I can read while taking a walk. I can understand what people are doing with reading the back of their uniform. I can talk to people a little bit if something makes me really scratch my head. And I can amuse people with my half German half English, and a bit of hand and face gestures. 

The Strangeness is mostly gone, even though I am not fluent in German. I think as long as one has a rough idea of what is going on in her immediate surroundings, she can be at ease. (Although I can also understand what is going on in my remote surroundings by reading newspapers, which I am also capable to do now.) The concept of being strange is somehow related to the other meaning of strangeness, which is weird. When meanings are hidden, one feels weird, confused. But when explanations are provided, the strangeness goes immediately.
