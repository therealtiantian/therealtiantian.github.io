It is a blessing that there is a property of finiteness attached to almost everything I have had the pleasure to see, hear and feel. Borges has a story in which people from a remote region gained the capacity of eternal life. An outsider traveled there, saw some people in a shallow pit, not too shallow though for them to climb up. They needed a hand. They were asking for that hand. But people outside of the pit were too bored to raise from their eternal activity of lying on the ground. 

It was a striking story for me, when I read it the first time in my early twenties. I was rebellious and a bit sad. World seemed absurd with its one and only promise being the annihilation of everything with or without meaning. That story kept me in awe for quite a while. I gradually started to sympathize with the eternal beings, even though I could not in any way put myself in their shoes. I imagined myself being hysterical out of boredom. That scared me much more than the perspective of death. 

It takes much more patience to appreciate finiteness than infinity. Infinity is such a perfect and satisfying conception. What can be better than the best? You look back at all the goodness endowed to your trivial existence, and start wishing it to recur infinitely. After all, eternity sounds like a noble pursuit. If someone wishes to pursue finiteness, she sounds lazy. 

Oftentimes, a minor event would trigger my appreciation of finiteness. Today is Sunday, I grabbed my laptop and phone to read something in a cafe. My phone is used as a hotspot for my laptop to compensate for the terrible internet connection. I found a cozy spot. I have coffee, water, and a lot of desire to read on a topic I have been curious for a while. And then my phone sends a message that it is going to die because I did not charge it properly last night. I did not bring a cable. Sooner or later I will have to go back home, reluctantly. But it somehow gives me an extra part of satisfaction when my phone is still lingering with its dying power to support me with internet. 

That is when I think of finiteness again. Switzerland has a registration system where one needs to report their “permanant residence” to the authority. I find that a bit wacky. If my existence is not permanant, how can my residence be permanant? Of course, the property will most possibly last longer than my life, but it is still far from permanant. Let alone my relationship with the property I am currently living in. It is not only not permanant, but not even going to be long enough for me to establish my dominance. 

I find that bittersweetness particularly healing. Or cathartic, if you will. It gives me a justified reason to fall into the trap of sentimentalism without hating myself for it afterwards, because the object of sentiment is not all about me. Of course, I have mixed feelings with my own finiteness, but in this case, the sadness comes from the futility of stopping anything at all from dying and rotting. I am only one of the enormous number of entities with that specific fate. 

That is the curse of being, but that is also the blessing of being.
