What is my taste? I ask this question a lot. I think this answer eventually comes down to humor. That’s what satisfies me the most. I like what gives me a smirk. I actually smirk more than one should, even sometimes at academic papers. But I don’t give my smirk to what a lot of people would laugh to. My smirk is something I value and offer sparsingly. 

I sprawl in the sea of music, but I find myself the most satisfied listening to punk, and it’s not even because of their subversive feature, but because of their humor. Ideological chanting is probably stimulating, when I feel stifled and need a superficial stir. But those that worth my smirk are the ones with delicatehumor. Sarcasm is one of my preferences. It’s hard to define good sarcasm, but I think it has to face the reality of the cliché in our world and give honest response to it. Sarcasm is immediately recognized by a lover and expert of sarcasm, but treated with another set of semantics by another demography. That’s probably why people make friends when they smirk at something together. They share the craftsmanship of sarcasm. They belong to one guild. 

But a flush of humor is usually bad humor. Humor is a picky spice that does not go with every course. It selects its course. It focuses on a few dishes, which after a complicated mixture of ingredients, are ready to welcome a sense of quality humor. Humor is the agent. It takes actions and makes decisions. It is no use to beg for humor when circumstances are not mature. Humor does not budge. 

That’s why I do not expect humor to happen a lot in my life. I also accept mundanity much encouragingly than the average threshold. I willingly and happily lead a life of a drudge, and then wait for the situations that invites a good sense of humor. When it knocks on the door, I give a smirk.
