The slime uneasiness sucks on the corner of the celling,

Where flakes fall.

It wins over gravity, hedged by reality, 

granted permission by a nasty ego, 

goes against the will of everybody. 


It licks your shouder when you put your back to it,

retreats to its corner when confronted, 

but as long as you release it from your mind,

it sneaks back, knocking on the pores of your skin,

and marches onward at your philanthropic mercy. 


No way it is going to leave, because it is a

parasite of life. 

No light comes from it, 

but it dangles as a chandelier.
