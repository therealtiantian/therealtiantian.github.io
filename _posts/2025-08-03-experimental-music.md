title: Experimental Music, a culture of dissidence

Music used to be created for a joint sensation, stimulating auditors’ similar response and bind them together with a consensus. But after the modernists, the musicians started to deviate from that ambition, until deconstructed it and finally replaced it with works that sanctify unique experience of every one of the listeners/experiencers. Shortly, the experimental musicians try to utilize and elevate the ordinary, the weird and the ugly, interrogating the validity of an established standard of pleasure. 

Experimental music ferments a culture of dissidence. It swaps the binary codes, or to be more precise, it obliviates the semiotic cues. Every interpretation is possible and legal, and anyone’s attempt to pin it down with authority is ridiculous. During a show, participants are only loosely connected with a shared space, there isn’t any civil responsibility to experience anything according to design. Any reflective behavior is allowed -  it can be a period of meditation, entertainment, annoyance, boredom, or agitation. 

Experiments are actions without rehearsals, and they unfold through time without certainty. This process can be a function of either restricted or unrestricted variables, either singular or multiple variables. For example, some kinds of aleatory works use a dice or a controlled movement, which reduces the outcome’s possibilities. Some artists not only let anything happen within the possibilities in the space, but solicits happenings from the audience, or create prompts to evoke events. The other end of the spectrum is letting events explode without intervention, such as a silent and motionless performance. This method is to reduce suppression instead of increasing facilitation. 

There is, of course, much more less “hardcore” experimental music. Most experiments still follow a set of protocols, but strategically drop another set of them as a tribute to the experimental muses. These experiments are more practical, and even replicable. They need much less openness from the audience, and offer a better service to the clients’ eardrum. These musicians carry the professional ethics that have been passed on for generations of their predecessors, which is to be a provider of expectations mixed with a civilized portion of surprises.
