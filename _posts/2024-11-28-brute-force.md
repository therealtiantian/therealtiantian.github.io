Dad’s childhood house has just been decided to be demolished. These kinds of decisions are always acted upon the objects they found interesting, upon the people who seem to possess these objects. 

I don’t remember much about this house. My mom was born in the city, and she married my dad, a village guy. Dad doesn’t look village though. He has the appearance of a lady’s man. I once asked him, were you popular among the girls at your school? He went, I wouldn’t say otherwise. 

Mom didn’t like villages. It was backwards. It still is. When mom and dad took me to dad’s house for the New Year’s celebration, she was asked to sit with all the other women and children at a table with half the height of a proper one. Women could not eat with the same status as men. She decided not to go there again. And she kept her words. So I didn’t really go either. 

Thus I cannot say much about it. I have some vague memories about an unappealing toilet that was just a deep hole into the ground. I had to walk pass a dog that looked like he didn’t enjoy strangers releasing themselves in the toilet of his house. I had to be accompanied by someone from the family everytime I had to pee or take a shit just for this reason. They would wait for me, not really outside, because we both were. The toilet had a roof, so it provided some shelter for pee-takers during rain and snow, but if it was windy, it wouldn’t have more functionalities to offer. 

During the few times that I was actually there, I remembered being chilly almost all the time. Radiators were non-existent in the villages, and people generally burn coals to endure the winter. Coldness could lure people into making silly decisions, like shutting their windows and doors during the night while buring coal. Dad was nearly killed once, being very warm with the coal buring all night, absolutely no draught sneaking inside from any cracks of the windows. 

The house was made of wood and brick. The wooden roof smelled moldy, probably due to ventilation problem. It had a Chinese structure, which means all the rooms in one household connected into a circle, and the doors all face towards the center of it. The central area bounded by the roomss were a garden. The main gate faces the main room, indicating the highest status of the people living in it, usually by the exclusive standard of old age. 

Dad’s house was a little different in that there wasn’t a main room in that area, so grandparents lived in the one on the right side. I guess rightness is still higher than leftness, but this is just my conjecture. Their room was symmetrical. Walking inside, there was a table with the shape of a cube, and on each side there were two chairs roughly with the shape of two cubes stacking on tope of each other. The two chairs faced towards the door. Grandparents were supposed to sit on the two chairs facing outwards to talk to their inferiors. Pictures were hung on the walls, with symmetrical constellations. There probably were some ones capturing the reminiscence of the cultural revolution, but that I don’t really recall. The two sides of the table-chair centrality were communal areas and grandparents’ bed respectively. This table was that proper dining table at which only men can eat. 

I cannot say everything about it. I cannot even describe it from the perspective of an insider. Whenever thinking about the condo of my grandparents from my mom’s side, I attach it with a personal connection, as if thinking about a body part of mine. It is my extention. But dad’s house has always been far from me. I was a sporadic visitor. Looking at their lifestyle with curiosity and dazzlling. 

Dad’s parents passed some years ago. He’d always had a strong connection with them, but especially after he parted with mom, since he didn’t have more family members other than his parents and me. Mom’s parents love him, too, but he had to keep an arm’s length. Dad used to be a painter, and I used to hang a lot of his paintings in my room. When they parted, mom packed dad’s things and put them outside of our condo. He didn’t come to pick them up. Mom didn’t take them back, either. 

Dad texted me some days ago, saying he was going to travel back to the village for some demolition process. He stopped visiting it regularly after his parents passed away. 

He doesn’t have much belongs due to the fact they were left outside of the condo in which we used to live together. I remember going back to that condo once after mom had sold it, and took a look at the area where dad’s belonging’s used to be. It was occupied by something else. 

The vicinity of his house was planned for some reconstruction project. The village used to be a historical town, and it was decided the original architecture should be rebuilt in order to remember this fact.

Antiques demolished for a reconstruction of official antiques. 

In a court, a judge would declare a statement false without material evidence. In a scientific world, my memory is this kind of narrative. All the materials are easily demolished by invincible force. Only the mind, along with the memories, keeps archive, retains history, celebrates love and courage. I trust it and cherishes it. With my pen, I materialize them, until it is proved false due to the lack of evidence.
