There are generally these two processes of seeing a problem, or a topic of interest. One is grabing the structure before filling the details, the other is exploring the particulars before coming to a hypothesis. This is very close to the deductive and inductive methods of using logic. 

A poet’s task is to collect instantiations. You seldomly see a poet giving a guideline of what the world is about. They give out very specific lives and pains and happiness and sorrows. They don’t mind what the rest of the world is doing. When they look at an object/person, they focus entirely on them. When a poet sees a flower, the whole universe exists only for the purpose of that blossom. 

Some poets boasts to be philosophers, but they don’t dare to give out structures when they write poems. They might put meat in the structure, pretending they are writing only about the meat. That is the best they can do. Give generalisation is blasphemous for a poet.  

A philosopher is the opposite. They look at the world from a few guidelines and try to understand instances with their hypernyms, and then the hypernyms of the hypernyms, until there are only a bunch of matters, or even only one matter truly exist. Theologists definitely do that as well. Their job is to define the world before seeing it. 

Maths and computer science also comes from the philosophical branch. Mathematics is like an empty bookshelf. It holds a strong structure for all the specific knowledge that is gonna be put onto it. Computer science is the vulgerization of mathematics. It holds a virtual structure for all the tasks that can be calculated with it. I cannot think of a way to defend these subjects. They are guilty of spoiling a whole generation, impressing them with simplified reality, indulging their bulging ego, fulfilling their empty soul. 

I am one of the people spoiled by abstraction. I plead absolute guilty.
