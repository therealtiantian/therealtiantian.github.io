1. Reading primary texts is much easier than reading secondary ones or even attending lectures thereof. Pleasure is greater. The important scholars are often good writers, too. Reading De Saussure’s lecture transcrips this week gave me great pleasure. 

2. I am quite confused why universities (at least mine) do not require us to read much primary literature, instead we are given a lot of textbooks/contemperory texts with pretty mediocre ideas. (The ideas are, of course, newer.)

3. Recently got to know a scholar who has both science and social science background (a Chinese one). Started his second PhD in sociology at 40. There are still extremely talented people who believe knowledge in human beings is worthy. At least as important as natural sciences, as is the case of all times.

4. Seems sociology is an umbrella discipline of linguistics, law, politics, history, psychology, etc? Have the feeling that linguistics, taken out of society, is quite an empty pursuit. (Like analysing a chess game just to understand the game, to borrow De Saussure’s analogy, for my laziness of coming up with a new one.)

5. What is the point of crafting a system for the researcher’s own pleasure, if that system is not even artificial, as in math? If there is no system out there, what is the point of forging one?

6. Got a bit annoyed recently by the sheer amount of time needed to cook 3 meals per day. Realised my mom’s huge effort in raising me when my dad was absent. (Not a master cook, but she managed to give me an extremely healthy diet/diet habit.) Should start to appreciate how much she has done. 

7. Housework too. Takes a lot of time to do it properly. But then quickly it is undone. Like sisiphus. 

8. Can not think of a routine with minimal maintenance as long as cooking is involved. Cooking is a complex matter to be added into one’s life. 

9. But without cooking and housework, it’s easy to forget what it is to be a human. A human is a eating, sleeping, thinking, talking, doing being. She needs constant maintenance to counter entropy. Everyone has the tendency to be a mess. To cancel that one needs to work. 

10. Rock music reminds me that I am a chaos. Classical music reminds me that I look forward to Ordnung. 

11. Swiss bread is too salty.
