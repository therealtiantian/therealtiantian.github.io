Yeh, 6 am, stuck with my paper again. I get the feeling that there is something wrong with my scheme, but I cannot pin it down. I also don’t think anyone can give me an answer, because eventually, what I write is about what I believe is true, with sufficient evidence, of course.

But different beliefs can still lead to different conclusions, even when the evidence is the same. I don’t think I can argue for something I fundamentally think is wrong. That is very much against the reason I am doing academics. I got quite tired of that relativism in industries. If I have to be relative, then I might as well go back to industries and at least make use of my relativism for something useful or handy. 

Eventually, I need to understand what gives quantitative research justification. I cannot wrap my head around the fact that my computation with a machine for two weeks accords with a piece of common ground knowledge whose slight adjustment benefits almost nobody else. Not even me, actually. In fact, I will be the biggest victim of my conduction of this kind of research. Because I would’ve wasted the only possession I truly have, which is a period of my very limited lifetime. 

But I can only figure it out when I have conducted that research at least once, or possibly many times, if I am really suspicious of my bias. That said, the biggest reason I am doing quantitive research is my perennial prejudice against quantitive research. I wanted to do justice to what I have a bad instinct with. 

Along that path, I should definitely keep the research going. It probably ends up pretty ugly, but I am willing to devote some time in figuring that out. I once had a conversation with a friend, and we argued quite a while about it (we argue with proper demeanour all the time, and that is our way of being friends), and he thought academy after Kant has ditched the ambition to the absolute truth, but transitioned to incrementally update theroms so that they improve their usefulness. I very much disagreed, because I think the fact that the aforementioned happens is a result of the pursuit of the truth, or the byproduct thereof. The intention has never wavered, which is to know what is there to be known. 

I think quantitative method is going to keep bothering me, but I have to face the fact that it is what makes subjective knowledge objective, and what pushes our opinions forward for the possibility of a meaningful conversation. Otherwise, the world would be filled with individuals’ own life theories, and a world of unfalsifiable theories is going to make a lot of people very confused. 

Yup, that is almost what I wanted to say today. I’ll start working.
