I was constantly reminded of the year in Yunnan. After the disappointing year of 2022 in Shanghai, many chose to leave the city temperarily or for good. Turned out I belonged to the latter, but back in 22 I did not know. Before that, Shanghai had given off the vibe of a different society from the rest of the country. Relatively free market, relatively good cultural scene, a relatively mixed bag of population that contained everything without too much complaint. The last one was not due to its inclusion, but the ultimate apathy to human beings that predicates all metropolises in the world. 

But 22 gave everybody a painful reminder of reality. Shanghai was but a sporadic anomaly, and that anomaly had a strong tendency to conform, given but a slight push. I had just moved out of my apartment without signing a new one, so I stayed in a hostel. I stored all the belongings that I hadn’t donated or given away in a shared warehouse, and decided to crash a couple nights in that cramped room before resuming my life. Turned out I never signed any new apartment in Shanghai. I donated and gave away the remaining belongings in the warehouse and went to Yunnan. I brought a suitcase of 36 liters. It could be stowed in a cabin. 

It was early summer but Shanghai was already burning, synchronising with its inhabitants. After landed in Kunming, the provincial city of Yunnan, I was offered a good old 20 degree celcus as most sympathetic early summers did. I checked in a hostel and thus started my wandering year. 

I never knew it could be this long. But it was. I was Nick from the Great Gatsby, but only he was thrown into the upper society and I into the excluded, the lost, and the other-worldly. Yunnan was distant enough to maintain integrity, but not too distant to ring an alarm to anyone in charge. It was what I had thought Shanghai had been before figuring out its near-perfect pretence. At the end of the day, Shanghai was too strong, too powerful, and too big of a target to be ignored by even those with the worst eyesight. 

The first and foremost of becoming a hippie is to find the hippies you agreed with and join them. Like any other groups bound by a vague term, hippies divulged a diverse chunk of contradictory ideas, but it took some time and patience to figure out. They cared about different aspects and hippied accordingly, but it could be that they hippied unintentionally also in other aspects that they did not care. Hippiness had an inherent inertia. Once you started hippying, it was easy to hippie all the way. 

You could also do exclusion. That is, reducing the options with errors. The easiest ones to exclude were the dietary hippies, the alchoholic hippies, and the heartbroken hippies. They mostly hippied due to a specific lifestyle or a contingent event in life. They stuck together to consume certain food, drinks or sad stories. There were also bourgeois hippies, or yuppies, if you will. They came for vacations or early retirement at 21. There were tech hippies, the digital nomads so to speak. They were wildlife programmers who behaved almost the same as the domestic ones. Others needed a little more strategy, but you would figure it out. 

I wandered mostly within several cities. Kunming was not very hippie-dense, but as the provincial city, it was where hippies came once in a while for administrative matters. It was where hippies dressed up as a normie and took public transportation with a book in their hands which revealed their identity to the observant ones. But that was not strictly the case, because people in Kunming generally read much more than other cities in which I had had the opportunity to live. Mostly, I lived in Kunming, because I was at most a half-hippie. Still a 70% Shanghai white-collar who was addicted to remotely working on side projects. But from time to time, I grabbed my 36-liter suitcase and took on trains and buses and coaches and motorcycles to the real hippie cities and areas. 

One convenience was that there were specific commercial infrastructure that catered to hippies. That means each city had a hostel that was the hostel, a restaurant that was the restaurant, and so on. You could easily meet the same one you had met a week ago in another city. Hippies did not need to exchange contacts, because they always met each other on a statistical base. 

But all hippies hiked. That was what united them despite of discrepant ideologies. The mountains were where differences were alleviated and consensus reached despite only temperarily. Hippies did not easily agree. If they did, they had not been needed to become hippies. 

I left after a year as a few of others did from the gang with whom I hung out with. We were the temps. We were still quite serious to build life with some vague plan, and received almost enough nourishment from hippiness to keep going with that plan. We were probably looked down upon also by the other hippies, who chose that life many years ago and kept their words. 

However, by some occasional sparks, I thought about Yunnan.
