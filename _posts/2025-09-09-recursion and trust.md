title: Recursion and Trust

What keeps poping up in my head recently is something I learned in the recursion session from MIT’s python course by Dr. Ana Bell. Recursion is this black-box-like brain-teasing method that, once you write couple lines of code, keeps repeating itself until the solution is found. Dr. Bell says, there’s a lot of trust going on, you guys. 

Recursion is kind of like induction in the world of proof, which proves the final therom as long as the base case is fine and the way from any n to n+1 is connected. For a recursive method, you only need to know the answer to the smallest problem, and then the machine keeps seperating the task to smaller ones the same nature until it meets the real smallest problem.  

In a sense recursion is like a domino. You only need one force to the first piece, and as long as it transmits that force to the second one, the final piece should be knocked down with a bit of waiting. But imagine someone being skeptical of the law of physics, they would uncontrollably keep checking the chain of progress, worrying about a miss in the middle. In this scenario, if the chain is unimaginably long, the person would have to spend a long time checking what is out of their control, and what is granted to succeed. 

Of course, blind confidence in physics or any sciences leads to another arrogance, but that is a seperate matter, because I don’t think the practical value of the law of gravity on a set of domino is worth questioning. Along with this train of thought, what is needed, apart from time, is trust. 

Without a fair amount of trust, one cannot really function in the world. When I ride off a steep hill on my bike, I always remind myself to trust whatever is there to be trusted. I have a decent level of expertise with biking, and I have a well-maintained bike and sometimes a helmet if I feel like it. I have pretty decent eyesight, and a well-functioning alarm instinct. I follow the traffic rules and speed limit. There is a certain chance that I get killed by a DUI, but I gotta trust that I do not. The reason I use this trivia as example is because I used to be very scared of speed. And the way I got over it is no other than a healthy amount of trust. 

I think recursion is somehow like riding off a hill. For people who are tolerant to speed, that could be analogous with a much more aggressive vehicle. As long as you don’t fool around with the process, there is a good chance of guarantee that the task is going to finish with time, after it starts good and takes good steps.
