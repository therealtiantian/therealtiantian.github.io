I didn’t go through the traditional academic route, which is basically a highway from bachelor to PhD. My bachelor years were spent with a lot of rebellion and exploration. I did work very hard during those years to consolidate my language skills, that is, pragmatics. I believed that language is dead unless it is used, so I didn’t put much effort on consolidating the knowledge on linguistics, instead I put a lot of effort in observing language and using language. 

Fast forward to my bachelor’s graduation, I still chose the pragmatic path. I started working headlong in communication industry, and later media publication. I still heavily focued on how to effectively use language and make actions with language. 

After multiple years of that, now I am back to University with a genuine interest in language itself, that is linguistics. Now I am struggling to get rid of the habits that I accumulated from my Bachelors all the way to my industry experience, which hinders my linguistic research. I need to transition myself from using language to observing it and analysing it. And I do need to change myself a lot in order to do it. 

First and foremost is my tendency to learn absolutely everything of a big field before writing anything. This is a very “magazine” style working-process. Because magazine articles usually don’t try to answer a question, instead, it is an opinion piece of work that can only be synthesized after the writer has enough materials in their head. It is doable in publication because those scales are mostly small and it is possible to exhaust the knowledge before writing, but it is not the case any more in academics. 

And when I write, I tend to give some patterns I see without empirical evidence, because the materials in my head are too heavy and too mixed-up that I cannot slice any detail out of it. The magazine articles are usually short and subjective, which often carries opinions that cannot be verified. I tend to do that. Academic research should come from a specific question (whose scale matches the length of the paper), and aim at finding the answer along with the writing process. Each step should be as bulletproof as possible with strong evidence. 

Another one is that I ask questions that are way too big. That is actually a very Chinese mindset. The Chinese philosophy aims at giving a wholesome explanation of the world without strict deduction or induction, and it cannot be falsified. Besides, there aren’t a lot of schools of philosophy in the Chinese tradition. The basic schools of thoughts are considered almost holy and later scholars only add onto them, which almost frames those couple schools of philosophy as universal truth. The consequence of that is that there’s always an ambition in me that want to be as general as possible. This is quite ridiculous. I don’t mean that I am dissatisfied with my cultural identity, but it is not the appropriate academic attitude. 

I also tend to dwell on details. Again, this is doable and even rewarding in industry, because everybody only takes care of a small patch of the work. But in academic writing, dwelling on details like mathematical methods in reading a quantitative research makes any task impossible to finish. I should definitely look at details, but not any detail, just the right details. And when I evolve from the newbie phase, I can look at more details. But now is definitely not the right time for that. 

There are still much more, but I only have this much of time today, so I’ll wrap it up.
