Well, this feels kinda like a click bait (even though I assume my websites only have a scarce amount of visiters), but I have been really thinking about this lately. 

My focus here is mainly on practical matters. I remember reading from the Stanford Philosophy Encyclopedia about a similar concept called “infinite regress,” meaning if knowledge has to be acquired through a medium, then the medium needs a more primitive medium, until the regress falls into backward infinity. So what I wanted to say is, if one wants to learn anything at all, once they have the most basic knowledge, then it is the fastest if they learn by doing the thing instead of learning more auxiliary knowledge. 

For example, the answer to “how to write” is to write, the answer to “how to write a paper” is to write a paper, and the answer to “how to be a good badminton player” is to play badminton, easy as that. The frustration comes from the period when one is not good enough and figure there must be something else that is wrong. But mostly the reason is just they are progressing, so naturally it feels bad. Doing hard things doesn’t always feel good. 

I kinda want to write about this not to lecture anyone else but to remind myself. I tend to fall in the rabbit hole of searching for “how to do abcd” after I just tried once and didn’t do it perfectly. This loop really doesn’t end, and is really an infinite regress.
