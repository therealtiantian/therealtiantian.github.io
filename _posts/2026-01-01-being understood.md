Being understood is extremely satisfying. I first knew this when my grandma told me she was continuously treated unfairly by my mom. I knew she was not lying, because I was present in some of those circumstances. I tried to solve her problem, but no matter how I tried, she seemed not want me to do anything substantial. Then I realised she only really enjoyed my understanding of the whole situation, and that was good enough for her. Comparing to me stepping in, changing the situation, which might lead to worse results, she prefers having some certain comfort and live her life as usual. 

I was recently discussing something of this sort with a friend. Somehow humans are extremely pathetic in that we are totally isolated by the border of our skins. No one knows what is going on inside another set of skin. We invented, or were endowed, language to alleviate that pain. But language is not only extremely limited but also does not provide another witness to our words. Thus what we speak seems always insufficient to the truth. Logic is a compromise. It is almost sufficient for us to agree on logic. With logic, we sad, painful, lonely beings can somehow reach consensus on a whole mental universe. What a feat. 

But somehow scientists discovered there is an area in our brains specifically assigned to imagine other people’s situation. That area makes us sympathetic, and able to understand another one based on the ground that we have similar mechanism for multiple triggers. When we are verbally informed of another person’s experience of our inner experience, that satisfaction is almost unworldly. 

I enjoy being understood, of course. I enjoy understanding others, too. But that understanding is usually stripped away with friends being apart, family living far away, or some unexpected events that make it not possible anymore. Then I would sleep on it, and keep going with that uneasiness. There will come another circumstance when another understanding occurs. No one can be understood all the time, we have to live with that itchiness and try to have some peace with it. 

Understanding is almost addictive. Once one has had that understanding, it is cruel to take that away. It is even better if one has never had that understanding. The premise of true understanding is that the other person has gone through some similar toil, or at least painful of a similar level. Then you know that understanding is genuine, instead of politeness or hypocricy. Sympathy without understanding is almost an insult. That is called pity and no one wants that. 

When Desdemona declares her love for Othello, she says she loves him for his suffering. That is probably my favorate line of Shakespeare. I do not really trust unsuffered souls for a confession of any sort, because that almost guarantees the superficiality of understanding. 

I had a conversation with my dad today and he said something quite nice. "Human beings are a complex phenomenon." That is absolutely right. If someone breaks into that complex and manages to understand just a little bit, it would be a great feat.
