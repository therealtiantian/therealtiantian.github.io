An abstraction of an entity E is itself another entity e that reveals only those characteristics of E considered relevant in some context while suppressing other characteristics deemed irrelevant (in that context). —Subrata Dasgupta

Hierarchical organization is a means of managing the complexity of an entity. —Herbert Simon

As the first quote states, the hierarchy of a computational structure means the higher you go up, the less detail you have. This is quite an opposite of what one would normally consider of a hierarchy. Take a feudal hierarchy for example, it means the higher one goes, the more something is granted to the bearer. The computational hierarchy is instead very similar to what is discussed in ontology: how to reduce the number of entities in the world until there are only a bunch of them, or two of them, or one, or nothing? The principle of reduction is to lose the “non-salient” uniqueness of individuals. The more unique features one loses, the closer they are to inventing a new hierarchical structure. 

Here I want to digress a bit and talk a bit about its analogy with life. What is ironic about this abstraction is that the uniqueness is actually what makes the world interesting. No two things in the natural world are identical. It is mainly the unpredicted element in the world that makes life playable. But the predictable elements are makes life a lot more comfortable and convenient. So there is always this contention between zoom-in and zoom-out. Mostly, one tends to zoom out for duty, which can be automated, and zoom in for fun. 

Now I’ll get back to the hierarchy. Take a class for example, a parent class do not consist of more attributes, but less. It is a general shape of something. It includes a lot and really does not care what differences they have. I can be in the same class with a stone when that class is EntityOnTheEarth. But under that class, there can be children classes, such as AnimatedEntity and InanimatedEntity, here each one not only inherits the properties of EntityOnTheEarth but each contributes more attributes for a finer-grained category. 

What adds more philosophical spice is that everything is an object in object-oriented languages. A number is an object, a sentence is an object, a function, a file, a package, a library, an application. This is quite a realist view as opposed to the nominalist one. In this near-perfect world of computation, everything exists. This fact makes the world not only hierarchical but also egalitarian. Not bad, huh? In the real world, these two never happen at the same time. This is exactly because the kind of abstraction in computation goes up by reduction instead of addition. When all features are lost, anything becomes just a thing, an object. We can properly say that the highest abstraction in OOP is object. Under this holy thing, everything is equally object-ive.
