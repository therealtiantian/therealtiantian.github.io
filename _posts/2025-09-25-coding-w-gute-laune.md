I kinda got stuck in my project, and I wonder why. Normally I am pretty steadfast in hands-on projects, and I find it more fun to do/write than to read. But I have some habits that drags down my process.

Firstly it is my perfectionist and aesthetic standard. I treat coding as an essentially pleasing type of work which can be appreciated even from a literary point of view. I keep pushing myself to find the most beautiful way of coding, which really bogs me down. The thing is, this approach is not necessarily wrong, in fact, it is beneficial when I am reaching a higher expertise. But now I have to live with some level of chaos and have to admit that the most important thing is to get the code going, get the work done, compute, just compute. 

With that in mind, I absolutely cannot keep checking my previous code. I have to live with the fact that what has been done is done. And what I need to check is only my last step and my last result, and then keep working with them. If something doesn’t look right, fix it without changing the whole logic. This is somehow like the domino metaphor that I used to write about, in that I cannot be fixated at the first piece or the part that has already fallen. I need to keep the whole thing rolling. Sometimes it doesn’t go through the shortest route, but it’s fine. You can work on that later if you want to. 

Secondly is definitely my insufficient coding proficiency, but what I want to talk about is not this insufficiency, but to live with that insufficiency. Everybody is insufficient even in their best field of work, and I really cannot go back and train my coding proficiency with another project. I have to stick with the project I have at hand and train along with the difficulty. It doesn’t make sense to try to finish another task for a specific skill that you need for your task at hand. You have to practice with the problem you have, not another problem that you invent for practicing purpose. 

These are the main points, but I think another one is to be patient, and that is something different that the other issues. I haven’t solved the problem, because I am still in the process, and I will finish it after enough amount of time. The thing is, I have to believe that it will be solved sometime, someday, with moderately good discipline, and eine gute laune.
