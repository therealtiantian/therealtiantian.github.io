In general, if you want to answer any meaningful questions in science, there is a fundamental necessity to grasp the basics before actually getting into it. What is the nature of your question? How does your question fit into a bigger picture? Is this question a contingent playful one or is it seriously urgent? Do you intend to collect opinions/hypotheses for a survey or do you plan to go for evidents for a hypothesis? Do you plan to test someone else’s hypothesis or your own observations? How do you plan to break down your problem-solving process? 

Reading papers blindlessly before knowing the basics of the field is also horrendous. What have people done? what methods do they generally use? What have they proven right or wrong? Jumping into close-reading of papers is gonna bog any motivational spirit down quickly. 

Time is always insufficient. It should be allocated economically. I find a lot of scientific paper unnecessarily pendantic on methodologies when their research is trivial. But I get the point. An innovation of methods is the only thing you can do when neither your question nor your answer is interesting. You can always design a luxurious hammer when you find your carpenting job meaningless and mundane, when customers always just wants ugly chairs that aren’t comfortable. So you spend time on hammers. 

Methods should be approached systematically too before jumping into knowing the details of every one of them. It’s like crafting a basic hammer before learning how very artistically-mature carpenters even engrave it with exotic geometric patterns.
