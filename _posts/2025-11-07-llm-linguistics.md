title: 2 Cents on LLM for Linguistic Research

As is known to some of my best friends whom I haunted for multiple months to discuss my ideas, I used LLM for my last semantic project instead of word2vec, which was my initial plan. After that I started to have very negative opinion about LLM on multiple fronts. 

LLM as a data evaluation method is very unconvincing. If you cannot explain what is your tool, how can you justify the validity of your result? This made me very unhappy. Fundamentally, I have an aesthetic standard on my work process. LLM as a method is extremely inelegent. I have to say it left me very dissatisfied even with a result that seems pretty good. 

Moreover, it teaches me almost nothing about language. No insight whatsoever. I learned along the way all the mechanisms of LLM though, but that is not the question I wanted to answer. I was also able to code better. But that still was not what I meant to do. If I wanted to learn a fact on language, how does it do me good with exercise on coding and calculating? 

This project is the first one that upon completion, I do not want to look back or read again. I am usually very satisfied with my paper or my work. I put effort in it, I am honest with the good and bad of my process, and I deliver something that is both logical and beautiful. But this project, I do not see neither the beauty nor the knowledge in it. 

The data was ugly too. Because it does not require beautiful data. It prefers quantity over quality. I vaguely cleaned my data into bags of words and that was it. I learned nothing from my data too. Because the data was not meant to be read. 

In any sense, I do not intend to use it again for further projects unless strictly necessary. I understand its utility on multiple fronts, but for linguistic research it repels me a bit. I hope in the future there are projects with LLM that is actually pleasant and can revert my opinion. But until then, I stay firm.
