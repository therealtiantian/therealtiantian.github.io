“-Ich glaube nicht Fluch-magie.” “-Leider glaubt der Fluch an Sie.”
                  - *The Curse* / *Der Fluch*, *Tatortreiniger* S04E04

This is my favorate episode of German TV so far. I enjoyed quite a few episodes from *Tatortreiniger*, but this one is an all time Liblingsfolge.

Schotty is a crime scene cleaner employed by a third party company Lausen that provides this kind of niche service to the police. In this episode he is sent to a generational mansion owned by an heir of a wanna-be “rhymer,” who killed himself in the property due to the lack of recognition  by the public of his self-claimed poetic talent. Before death, he cursed the house with a loop to go back to the beginning of an event if rhyme schemes were broken during conversation. The vessel of the curse is the curser’s suicidal blood seeped into the wooden floor, resisting all possible ways of normal cleaning for over 200 years, which is why the heir hires Lausen GMBH to clean the blood and break the curse.

The pseudo code for this curse goes like this:

```python
from datetime import datetime
start_time = datetime.now( )
for (a, b) in convo: 
# (a, b) is a pair of sentence
# convo is a list of ordered pairs
	if a.rhyme != b.rhyme:
	later_time = datetime.now( )
	datetime.now = start_time

```
This code is reductive, demonstrative and doesn’t hold for the actual situation, because the conversation unfolds through time and the real code should capture the conversation’s incremental property. Besides, in the real coding scenario, it’s not legal to reset the current time through the method aforementioned. 

Back to the show. The interesting property of the curse is that the characters’ epistemic statuses are not reset with a new loop, making possible for Schotty to learn the situation with trial and error. He is thrown back to the beginning of the project once and again, but heuristically accepts the reality as physical instead of psychological. 

Schotty then wants to leave the place to get out of the mess, but this curse has another checkpoint: for anyone in the event in question, their action of leaving the mansion also triggers a reset of time. Whenever Schotty gets into his car and shuts the door, he is sent back to the mansion’s front door with everything else reset. 

So the curse constantly checks the satisfation of two laws: for any event A with a goal, the conversation B (not empty) happened in A should be a set of continuous rhyming couplets, and A should be completed with its predefined aim achieved. 

When Schotty figures out the mechanics of the curse, a otherworldly rhyming talent burst out of him. This is the ironic part. Compared to the nobelman, the dead curser, who practices continuously to be a master, Schotty grabs the talent immediately to solve a practical problem. Form is supposed to be a container for the content, making it easier for transportaion (communication) and more pleasant to the senses (organized, designed), but a lifetime’s practice of the form is like producing containers without adding meaningful content. 

The story goes on with intensive rhyming conversation. To guarantee a smoother composition during the cleaning process, they decide to go with safer rhymes like “er,” but soon get stuck in the same topic and running out of words. To break this loop and talk more freely, they start to invent imaginary objects with certain properties and stories. But then these objects start to show up in the house. Here the house reveals its capacity to contain a poetic world and is impervious to the extradiegetic world. Once an event starts, the house becomes a self-contained system with its own logic. It does have interaction with the outer world, but as soon as its local event is triggered, it starts to run self-sufficiently. The house is a local scope. 

With declaration, there exists a gorilla and an instrument “Krumseltört.” The two main characters at first wants to defeat the gorilla with new objects/weapons that they declare on the way, but soon realize the gorilla doesn’t have the properties of an extradiegetic gorila: fierce, aggressive. Instead, it adopts the features that they, the inventors give it: a music virtuoso, a Krumseltört player. It is also anthropomorphic. Soon they start to build a parallel life in the house. 

Note that here the heir starts to gain control of the intradiegetic world: the mansion. That is why suddenly his ancestor, the curser, jumps out of his portrait and tries to shoot the gorilla. This is a battle of authorship. The dead old man wants to sustain his controlling position after death, so he doesn’t allow any new agent acting according to his heir’s will. But this time the heir stands up for himself with encouragement from Schotty, combined with the fact that as long as he has gained authorship of the story world, he can add property of aggression to his gorilla, which successfully forces his ancestor into the portrait and breaks the curse. 

The moral of the story is the contention of authorship after an author’s death. The mansion symbolizes the universe created by the original author. The heir is the author of the spinoffs of the original story. As for Schotty, he is a universe commuter who helps the heir win the battle with an outsider’s perspective. As long as the original author still has control, there exists a curse on all the spinoff writers. To break the curse, the author has to die completely, as in Roland Barthes' *The Death of the Author*.
