1. Again, impressed by De Saussure. At least every paragraph can be elaborated into a master’s paper. His insights on language is systematic and convincing. (And I don’t think the accusation of him detaching language from the real world is fair; but such is an inevitable consequence, or expansion, of his work.)

2. There might be no “quote” to “borrow” from a great piece of work. But it might (very well) tell you your thesis statement is not worth it. 

3. And looking for quote to cement your idea is just silly. If you elaborate on someone’s work, perfectly fine. If you skim through their work just to butcher it and take out one sentence (out of context) to save your idea, please leave it alone and defend your poor idea at the stake of your own reputation. 

4. Yep. So a lot of work is not worth doing. It deserves some time to figure it out before dedicating a large chunk of time, which is everybody’s only real posession.

5. You can really get annoyed by the pettiest trivium, if a similar trivium has once in the span of your life been harrassing you for a long time. It looks like overreacting but actually just an alarm giving you the impression that the chronic annoyance is coming back, it is coming back to get you. 

6. At such times, your rationality is not gonna help. You need to take a big breath, do something fun, or relax. Just tell your immune system that this is not danger. You are in good hands. You gotta believe that you have escaped danger and are in good hands. Otherwise life is impossible.

7. Danger is an interesting concept. The more you are exposed to real danger, the more you are conditioned to ignore petty danger. But the effect is not life-long. When you are removed from anything substantially dangerous for a long time, you start to imagine danger. This is when people become self-destructive. 

8. A good education equips one with the skill set to constrain the passion to a certain scale. Especially when it seems helplessly wild.
